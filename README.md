# Team-Rankings

In this mini project, I tested my understanding of binary trees and its implementations. 

The goal of this mini project is to randomly choose N number of teams and rank them by putting them in a binary tree so that the 1st team is the champion.
Binary trees were the data structure of choice because of fast insertion and search runtime complexity which is O(logn).

Whether a team beat another is determined by a made up function resembling a hash function.
